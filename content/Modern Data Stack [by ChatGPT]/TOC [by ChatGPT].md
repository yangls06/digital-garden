### Relational databases

Relational databases, also known as RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems), are databases that store data in tables with rows and columns, forming a structured relationship between data elements. These databases are based on the relational model proposed by E.F. Codd in 1970.

In a relational database, data is organized into tables, with each table representing a specific type of data, such as customer information, product information, or sales transactions. Each table has a set of columns that describe the properties or attributes of the data in that table. For example, a customer information table might have columns for first name, last name, email address, and postal code. Rows in the table represent individual records, with each row representing a single customer.

Relational databases use a language called Structured Query Language (SQL) to query and manipulate data stored in tables. This allows for the creation of complex queries and the ability to join data from multiple tables to produce a single result set.

Relational databases are widely used for a variety of applications and are a popular choice for managing structured data due to their ability to enforce relationships between data, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
